\section{Methods}

\subsection{Parameter Generation}
To obtain suitable parameters for the neuromuscular and impedance control
methods we rely on the dueling bandits optimization approach outlined in
\cref{sec:bandit_optimization}. Whereas in \cref{sec:bandit_optimization} we
optimized control parameters to match gait data at different speeds to achieve a
speed-adaptive control, in this work, we optimize control parameters to match
both undisturbed and disturbed gait in order to obtain robust control
parameters. We use the dataset provided by \citet{moore2015elaborate}, which
provides gait data for undisturbed walking and walking with treadmill velocity
disturbances.

For the neuromuscular control, we use the black-box CMA-ES
optimizer~\citep{hansen2006cma} to obtain parameters that can reproduce the
behavior of each subject in the gait dataset. The model proceeds by feeding joint
hip, knee, and ankle angles into the neuromuscular model which generates torques
for the knee and ankle. We optimize the parameters listed in
\cref{tab:nm_params_treadmill_exp} so the model's output torques match those in
the gait dataset. Specifically, we minimize the following cost function:
\begin{align}
    \Gamma &= \argmin_\Gamma \left(\tau_\tn{h} - \tau_\tn{nm} \right)^T
    \left(\tau_\tn{h} - \tau_\tn{nm} \right) + \alpha \xi_\tn{nm}^T \xi_\tn{nm}
\end{align}
where $(\tau_\tn{nm}, \xi_\tn{nm}) = \func{neuro}[\Gamma][]{\theta_\tn{h}}$ are
the torques and muscle activations generated by the neuromuscular model given
the human joint angle trajectories and model parameters $\Gamma$. $\alpha =
0.01$ is a small constant we use to help regularize the solutions and prevent
muscle stimulations from saturating. \Cref{fig:treadmill_nm_fit} shows an
example of the fit achieved to one subject's joint moments.

\end{figure}

\todo{fix reference}
To generate parameters for impedance control, which is described in full in
\cref{sec:back_impedance}, we follow a two step procedure: In the first step, we
identify appropriate joint angle thresholds that define the impedance
controller's finite state machine transition rules. The impedance control
transition from phase 1 to phase 2 of stance is based on the knee angle crossing
a threshold. We specify this threshold such that 95\% of steps in the subject's
gait data pass from phase 1 to phase 2. As we use gait data with disturbances,
this procedure automatically sets the threshold such that it allows for a large
degree of gait variation. Next, we identify the ankle angle threshold that
defines the transition between stance phases 2 and 3. Again, we set this
threshold such that 95\% of steps successfully complete the transition.

Once we identify the joint angle thresholds that define state transitions, we
next fit the impedance parameters within each phase. In each phase, the torque
output of the impedance control is 
\begin{align}
    \tau_\tn{imp} &= -k \left( \theta - \theta_0 \right) - b \dot{\theta} \\
        &= \begin{bmatrix} -\theta & -\dot{\theta} & 1 \end{bmatrix}
            \begin{bmatrix} k \\ b \\ k \theta_0 \end{bmatrix} \\
        &= \Theta \vec{k}
\end{align}
where $\Theta$ is a matrix of the subject's joint angles and velocities and
$\vec{k}$ is a vector of the impedance parameters. Therefore, the squared error
between the subject's joint torque and the impedance control model is
\begin{align}
    \epsilon_\tau & = {\left( \tau_\tn{imp} - \tau_\tn{h} \right)}^T 
        \left( \tau_\tn{imp} - \tau_\tn{h} \right) \\
        &= \vec{k}^T \Theta^T \Theta \vec{k} - 2\tau_\tn{h}^T \Theta \vec{k} 
        + \tau_\tn{h}^T \tau_\tn{h}
\end{align}
To calculate the impedance parameters for each phase we minimize the squared
error subject to the constraints that $k>0$ and ${b > 0}$, which ensures that
the resulting impedance models are stable. Finally, to obtain model parameters
that are robust to outlier steps in the dataset, we utilize the RANSAC procedure,
which iteratively solves the above optimization on randomly sampled subsets of
the data in order to classify and fit to inliers only
\citep{fischler1981random}.

    \citet{moore2015elaborate}. Note that green trajectories in knee moment plot
    and blue trajectories in ankle moment plot that do not track subject data
    are those that did not successfully transition to the next
    phase.}\label{fig:treadmill_imp_fit}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:treadmill_imp_fit} shows an example of the impedance control model
optimized to match one subject's gait data. In this figure, the color of the
lines indicates the phase of gait. We see that the majority of steps fit the
subject's joint moments (grey) well. However, there are a few steps for which
the color of the line and thus the phase does not transition properly.
Consequently, the resulting torque diverges greatly from the human data. This is
expected as the phase transition angles were selected such that 95\% of steps
pass through each phase transition. We did not allow 100\% percent of steps
through so as to ignore potential outlier steps.

\subsection{Iterative Learning}\label{sec:treadmill_exp_iterative_learning}
In~\cref{sec:bandit_methods}, in order to compensate for kinematic differences
between the joint angles in the gait dataset and the joint angles of the
prosthesis, we applied hand-tuned offsets to the measured prosthesis joint
angles before calculating the neuromuscular model torques
(\cref{eq:bias_param}). These offsets helped ensure the prosthesis achieved
comfortable levels of ankle dorsiflexion, and prevent knee over extension (or
flexion) during stance. In this experiment, in order to reduce the potential for
bias induced by hand tuning, we take a more systematic, iterative learning
approach to tuning these offsets.

During the iterative learning procedure, a subject walks with each parameter set
for both the neuromuscular and impedance controllers. The knee and ankle angle
trajectories during stance are recorded and after each step, the following
update rules are applied to the knee and ankle joint offsets
\begin{fullwidth}
\begin{align}
    \theta_\tn{knee}^\tn{offset} &\leftarrow \theta_\tn{knee}^\tn{offset} +
    k_\tn{lrn} \left(\theta_\tn{knee}^\tn{ext} - \theta_\tn{knee}^\tn{ext,tgt} \right)
    \left(\theta_\tn{knee}^\textrm{flex} < \theta_\tn{knee}^\tn{flex,max}
    \textrm{~OR~} \theta_\tn{knee}^\tn{ext} > \theta_\tn{knee}^\tn{ext,tgt}\right)\\
    \theta_\tn{ankle}^\tn{offset} &\leftarrow \theta_\tn{ankle}^\tn{offset} +
    k_\tn{lrn} \left(\theta_\tn{ankle}^\tn{flex} - \theta_\tn{ankle}^\tn{flex,tgt} \right),
\end{align}
\end{fullwidth}
where $k_\tn{lrn} = 0.05$ controls the learning rate,
$\theta_\tn{knee}^\tn{ext}$ and $\theta_\tn{knee}^\tn{ext,tgt} = 0^\circ$ are
the measured and target knee extension in mid-stance respectively and
$\theta_\tn{ankle}^\tn{flex}$ and $\theta_\tn{ankle}^\tn{flex,tgt} = 12^\circ$
are the measured and target ankle dorsiflexion in mid-stance respectively. The
conditional terms in the knee iterative learning rule prevent the knee offset
angle from inducing more knee flexion if the knee flexion in early stance
$\theta_\tn{knee}^\textrm{flex}$ crosses a threshold
$\theta_\tn{knee}^\tn{flex,max} = 10^\circ$.

\subsection{Treadmill Disturbance}\label{sec:treadmill_exp_disturbance}

\subsection{Experimental Protocol}

In our experiment, we evaluate the robustness and user ratings the neuromuscular
and impedance controllers in an experiment with able-bodied subjects wearing the
prosthesis via an adaptor. All subjects provided informed consent to
IRB-approved protocols. Subject's participated in a six-day procedure:

\todo{subject stats}

\begin{days}
    \item\label{list:exp_day_1} \emph{Practice Session} Subjects practiced
    walking on the prosthesis until they could achieve consistent gait without
    the use of hand-rails. Subjects who could not achieve hands free walking by
    the end of the two-hour practice session did not continue with the
    experiment.

    \item\label{list:exp_day_2} \emph{Practice Session} Subjects returned for a
    second day of practice walking on the prosthesis without the use of hand
    rails. In addition, on this day subjects practiced walking with the
    disturbance described in \cref{sec:treadmill_exp_disturbance}. This session
    lasted for 2 hours.

    \item\label{list:exp_day_3} \emph{Iterative Learning} Subjects walked with
    each of the nine parameter sets for each controller while the iterative
    learning procedure (\cref{sec:treadmill_exp_iterative_learning}) tuned the
    joint angle offsets. 

    \item\label{list:exp_day_4} \emph{Dueling Bandits Optimization} We performed
    the dueling bandits optimization procedure (\cref{sec:bandit_methods}) to
    find each subject's preferred parameters with both controllers. The order in
    which we optimized the controller was chosen randomly.

    \item\label{list:exp_day_5} \emph{Disturbance Experiment - Practice} We
    performed a practice session for the full disturbance experiment. First,
    subjects walked without the prosthesis at \unitfrac[0.8]{m}{s} for
    \unit[2]{minutes} without disturbances and then \unit[2]{minutes} with the
    treadmill velocity disturbance applied. After these no-prosthesis trials
    were completed, subjects donned the prosthesis and tested the neuromuscular
    and impedance controllers in five rounds of experiments, each consisting of
    three trials. In each trial, subjects walked without disturbances for
    \unit[1]{minute} and with disturbances for \unit[1]{minute}. In each round
    of trials, the subjects tested their preferred neuromuscular and impedance
    control parameters along with a set of suboptimal parameters for one
    controller type. Odd numbered subjects tested a suboptimal neuromuscular
    parameter set, while even numbered subjects tested a suboptimal impedance
    parameter set. For the suboptimal parameter set we chose the parameter set
    that ranked \#3/9 in terms of cumulative Copeland score at the end of the
    dueling bandits experiment.

    \item\label{list:exp_day_6} \emph{Disturbance Experiment - Data Collection}
    The procedure for this day was identical to that of \cref{list:exp_day_5}.
    Subjects wore Vicon motion capture markers during all trials, which captured
    the kinematics of the legs. Additionally, subjects wore a torso-mounted IMU
    that measured the roll and pitch torso angles during walking. During trials,
    we recorded the number of falls (measured as the number of times subjects
    needed to use the hand rails or the ceiling-mounted hardness to recover
    balance) and the user ratings for both the undisturbed and disturbed
    conditions of each trial.
