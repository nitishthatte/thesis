    The model consists of seven segments: left and right feet, shanks, and
    thighs, as well as a lumped head-arms-trunk (HAT) segment. Flexion joint
    angles are positive, extension joint angles are negative, and the zero angle
    configuration represents standing.}\label{fig:neuro_seven_link}

In the first part of this thesis, we investigate the ability of neuromuscular
reflex control to improve amputee gait robustness. To this end, here we provide
a more detailed review of the neuromuscular model components on which we base
our prosthesis control. Four parts comprise the model: a mechanical simulation
environment we use to obtain simulation results (\cref{sec:neuro_mech_model}),
biological motors modeled by the hill muscle model that apply torques to joints
(\cref{sec:neuro_hill_muscle}), and finally functionally-motivated stance
(\cref{sec:neuro_stance_reflexes}) and swing (\cref{sec:neuro_swing_reflexes})
reflexes that implement the key behaviors required for walking.
