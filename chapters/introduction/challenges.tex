\section{Challenges in Transfemoral Prosthesis
Control}\label{sec:intro_challenges} 

How to control active prostheses to achieve natural and robust gaits still
remains an open research question. Prosthesis controllers should address a
number of important challenges: 

\begin{challenges}
    \item\label{chal:robust} \emph{Control must ensure the stability of the
    prosthesis and amputee}~~\citet{miller2001prevalence} found that 49.2\% of
    lower limb amputees feared falling and that of those afraid of falls 76\%
    avoided physical activity as a result. Avoidance of physical activity is
    eminently concerning as it may lead to reduced strength, endurance, and
    balance, feeding a positive feedback loop that causes further debilitation.
    Therefore, to improve amputee quality of life it is imperative that powered
    prosthesis control strategies reduce the risk of falling. 
    
    In a traditional robotic system, this goal translates to ensuring the
    stability of the states of the robotic system. However, for a robotic
    prosthesis, the stability of the prosthesis state is insufficient to
    guarantee amputee stability. It is possible for all prosthesis states to be
    nominal while its user faces a precarious situation. Consequently,
    prosthesis controllers should ensure, either empirically or formally, that
    both the prosthesis and amputee states remain stable in the presence of a
    myriad of disturbances. We investigate the robustness of proposed prosthesis
    controllers in
    \cref{sec:control_sim,sec:nm_vs_imp,sec:trip_avoidance,sec:phase_estimation}.
    
    \item\label{chal:sensing} \emph{Control should ideally only use information
    that can be garnered from sensors on the prosthesis itself}~~Prosthesis
    control is complicated by sensing restrictions in a practical prosthetic
    device. While full instrumentation of the amputee's limbs and the prosthesis
    may help guarantee the stability of the overall system, in a practical
    prosthesis device, donning and doffing these sensors may be overly
    burdensome for amputees in the real world. Therefore, in this thesis, we
    only consider approaches that use information that could be reasonably
    garnered from sensors on the prosthesis and its socket.

    \item\label{chal:unique} \emph{Control must adapt to suit the needs of
    individual users}~~Variations in gait between amputees arise due to a number
    of factors including the amputee's limb-lengths, weight, strength,
    endurance, reason for amputation, time since amputation, experience, and
    personal preferences. Consequently, prostheses and controllers should be
    optimized to suit individual users. In this thesis, we explore methods for
    optimizing prosthesis parameters from user preferences
    (\cref{sec:preference_optimization}) and in later work propose control
    methods that automatically adapt to the user's gait
    (\cref{sec:trip_avoidance,sec:phase_estimation}).

    \item\label{chal:dynamic} \emph{Control should allow the prosthesis to
    interact dynamically with the amputee and environment}~~In human walking,
    during stance the leg acts in a compliant, spring-like manner
    \citep{geyer2006compliant} and significant time is spent in
    statically-unstable contact on the heel or toe, suggesting the importance of
    mechanical stability achieved via foot placement \citep{perry2010gait}.
    During swing, ballistic motion explains much of the leg trajectory
    \citep{mochon1980ballistic}. Indeed, much of the entire gait cycle can be
    explained via passive dynamics as evidenced by passive-dynamic walkers that
    can stably walk down slight inclines with no onboard power
    source~\citep{mcgeer1990passive, collins2005efficient}.

    Consequently, in order to ensure that amputee gaits are natural, efficient,
    and robust to disturbances, it is essential that the design and control of
    robotic prostheses admit and leverage the inherent dynamics of walking.
    Therefore, in \cref{sec:pros_design} we detail the mechanical design and
    low-level control of a prosthesis that can precisely track torques.
    Furthermore, all controllers proposed in this thesis command desired torques
    to the prosthesis to allow for compliant interaction with the amputee and
    the environment. This is either accomplished via controllers that directly
    command torques as a function of sensor inputs, as in the case of
    neuromuscular control (\cref{sec:neuro_model}), or, when kinematic
    objectives are specified, accomplished via the use of feedforward torque
    commands and low-gain feedback, as in the case of our proposed swing
    (\cref{sec:trip_avoidance}) and phase-based stance controllers
    (\cref{sec:phase_estimation}).
\end{challenges}

In this thesis, we primarily focus on addressing \cref{chal:robust} by
evaluating the robustness of various prosthesis controllers, learning from those
evaluations and proposing new methods to improve gait stability. However, in all
presented work we make sure to keep \crefrange{chal:sensing}{chal:dynamic} in
mind.
