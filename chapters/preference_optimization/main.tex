In \cref{sec:neuro_model} we optimized the neuromuscular and impedance control
strategies in simulation using a sampling-based optimization method called
CMA-ES \citep{hansen2006cma}. This method targeted specific cost functions.
However, as discussed in \cref{sec:back_optimization}, optimizing a single
objective may ignore other aspects of gait that are important. Therefore in this
thesis, we instead allow users to select parameters for the prosthesis by
providing qualitative feedback in the form of preferences between parameter
vectors. In this chapter, we discuss two approaches to optimizing parameters
with preferences. The first approach, outlined in
\crefrange{sec:bayes_intro}{sec:bayes_discussion}, uses Bayesian optimization.
This approach, however, was unable to scale to the dimensionality needed for
application to prosthesis control. Therefore, in
\crefrange{sec:bandit_intro}{sec:bandit_discussion} we outline a second method
that poses parameter selection as a dueling bandits problem \citep{yue2012k}.
