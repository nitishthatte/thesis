The experimental results from \cref{sec:nm_vs_imp}, in which we compared
neuromuscular and impedance control, revealed that trips during swing were one
of the most common causes for falls (\cref{tab:treadmill_exp_fall_reasons}). In
this chapter, we explore two potential methods for avoiding swing trips. The
first focuses on avoidance of obstacles during gait through online learning of
classifiers that can recognize the user's obstacle avoidance intent. In the
second, we directly address the trips during normal walking that were observed
in \cref{sec:nm_vs_imp} by planning swing trajectories that use an estimate of
the user's hip height and orientation to avoid premature ground contact.
