\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First, I would like to thank my advisor, Hartmut Geyer, for taking a chance and
letting me pursue this line of research and for his mentorship and patience over
the last six years. I would like to also thank my committee members Christopher
Atkeson, Aaron Johnson, Steven Collins, and Elliott Rouse for their many helpful
suggestions.

I would also like to thank my collaborators, Helei, Timothy, Nandagopal, Tanvi,
Alex, for assisting me with my research endeavors, and helping me keep the
prosthesis and the lab in working order. Additionally, I would like to thank
professor Goeran Fiedler for helping me perform experiments with amputee
subjects.

Thanks to my friends for making these years enjoyable despite the difficulties a
Ph.D. brings. Michael and Arun, thanks for being great roommates for so many
years. Will and Akshara, thanks for the dinners at bad restaurants followed by
even worse movies.

Thanks to my parents for their guidance early in my life that made this
accomplishment possible.

And most of all, to my wife Jennifer, thank you for your love, companionship,
and support over the last ten years. Finishing this thesis would not have been
possible without you.
